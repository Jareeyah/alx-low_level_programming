1. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
- Return: the converted number, or 0 if - there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1 - b is NULL
2. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- Format: see example
- You are not allowed to use arrays
- You are not allowed to use malloc
- You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
3. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
- Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured
4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
- Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred
5. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
- Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred
6. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
- You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
7. Write a function that checks the endianness.
- Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian
8.  Find the password for this program.
- Save the password in the file 101-password
- Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
